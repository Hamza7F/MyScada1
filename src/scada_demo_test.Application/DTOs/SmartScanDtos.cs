// Contract for the Smart & Fast RS-485 bus scan (POST /api/devices/{id}/scan).
// The scanner is handed everything it needs (gateway IP/port, timeouts, the
// address range to probe and the list of slave addresses already registered)
// so it stays decoupled from EF and never touches the database - discovery
// happens purely over Modbus + the Dual-Guard In-Memory Pipeline.
//
// Passes <= 0 means "auto" (the scanner applies its own tiering + pass count).
// DeepDuplicateCheck gates the two EXPENSIVE duplicate-detection reads (the
// winner's-own-window framing re-read and the foreign-window collision hunt);
// the cheap vote gate always runs. Quick scans set it false, "Find Sensors"
// leaves it true.
